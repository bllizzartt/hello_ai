General:
  ☐ comment shared/* for students
  □ fix deployment for woodsprite
  □ add deployment for Hello, Web!
  □ bring in "oil painting" from sketches

Bugs:
  □ ctrl-c doesn't always exit when on an "ask"
    □ actually it seems to not work in other cases in deno also, see auto_dnd
    □ also ask isn't actually async
    □ should I use something other than `prompt`?
