### Tips

- Have the Chrome Dev Tools open.
- Make sure `Dev Tools > Network > Disable cache` is checked.
- Keep an eye on console open. Thats where chrome tells you about problems.

### Running the Demos

Each demo is in its own folder. Most of the demo folders have a `deno.json` file that contains the task to run the demo. To run the demo, cd into the demo folder and run `deno task start`.

```bash
cd src/deno/hello_deno
deno task start
```
